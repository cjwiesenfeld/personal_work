# Projects:

# Project 1 - Stock picker:
  This was to help me choose which options to buy. It was a risky strategy but proved profitable. 
  I'd determine the most volatile stocks using this script, and buy straddled options.
# Project 2 - Coffee App (In progress):
  This app will allow users to rate and and find coffee near them.
  Opens the doors to less well known coffee sellers to make a name for themselves. (Bodegas, street carts, etc)
# Project 3 - QR Code site:
  If you need a QR code made, just paste the link and click create.
